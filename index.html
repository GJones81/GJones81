				<h2> Grocery Gopher - Express Application</h2>
				<p>This is an express app for saving, editing, and using a grocery list while shopping. It is styled with a mobile-first mindset. The app also includes an API to retrieve recipes and save them to a database.
				This app makes use of two tables to manage the grocery list. The active_list table is for the current list only, and is populated by a findOrCreate function so there aren't duplicate entries. 
				The inventory_list is populated by a simple create function. The presence of duplicate entires is used to create a list of all items purchased twice or more in the last 30 days.

				<h2>Exoplanet Seeker - Flask Application</h2>
				<p>This app collects a subset of the data available on NASA's Confirmed Exoplanet database table. Then it first presents that data to the user in a table format so that the user can see all of the data. 
				When the user is ready, they simply click on the 'Go Graph the Data' link and are taken to a page where they can select different values to graph, and what format of graph they would like to use.

				<h2>Mushroom Hunter</h2>
				<p> To begin play simply click on the button labeled ‘click here to get your flashlight and enter the mine’. Carefully search for the mushroom, and click on it.  
					Clicking on the mushroom gives you one point and ends the level. Click on the button labeled ‘click here to continue’ to go to the next level. 
					Starting at the second level a rat is randomly placed in the game area.  
					Each level after the second adds one more rat. There’s also a pause programmed into the game when you scroll over the rats. 
					As you progress in levels the pause decreases until it’s roughly 1/5 of a second. 
					If you let your ‘flashlight’ linger too long on the rats they’ll attack you and you'll lose a hit point.
